        <h2>About</h2>
        <div class="about-content">
            <div class="about-text">
                <p>As busy mothers and employees, friends Asia, Kasia and Rachel shared the frustrations of keeping a home tidy with each other. We decided to help each other ‘get our homes in order’ and realised we were so good at it that it was a service that we could offer others. First it was with wider family and friends but through recommendations from those who know and trust us we have grown to encompass so much more than just ‘decluttering’. We listen and understand our clients needs. Our services aim to ‘get your home in order’ and in so doing improve your daily life with systems and organisation that you can maintain and enjoy.</p>

                <p>All services are available for private homes or commercial premises.</p>
                <h3>Organising and Decluttering</h3>
                <p>After a free no obligation consultation we will offer you a personalised decluttering and space organisation package. Some people opt to do their whole house while others prefer to start with one room and we come back when they are ready to tackle the next section of their homes. No job is too big or too small! And don’t worry about the mess, we have seen it all and we love a challenge.</p>
                <h3>Pre and most move packing and installing service</h3>
                <p>Moving house is categorised as an event that over 65% of those interviewed considered more stressful than a job interview or a medical proceedure. With our help it doesn’t have to be like that. The earlier we get the call the better prepared we will be to advise and assist you. Moving has so many logistics and there is also the emotional and social upheaval that come with it. We can handle the entirety of organising and moving you from A to B so that your life can begin in a new place with all your home comforts and minus the chaos of trying to do it all by yourself.</p>
                <h3>House clearance after bereavement</h3>
                <p>We understand that having lost someone close the energy it will take to sort, dispose, and move their belongings without professional support can be truly daunting. During grief taking on such a huge project can seem too much for even the most capable people and we aim to render this service with compassion and care. Let us help you through this difficult time.</p>
                <h3>Corporate Move</h3>
                <p>Moving sites can be another professional headache that we can tackle for your business.

We assure you that we will find layout and storage solutions that make your new work environment as efficient and user friendly as possible.</p>
                <h3>Home staging</h3>
                <p>Whether you are hoping for a quick sale or are planning a home event which will include the taking of many photographs we can present your home for the results you desire. Having an outsiders eye we can ensure that only the best of your home is seen and appreciated by viewers.</p>
                <h3>Virtual Consultations</h3>
                <p>Start the process and find your way to organise and declutter your home, online and from the comfort of your home. We will maximise your results by zeroing in on the most problematic areas in the house and how best you can tackle them so that you can maintain the system we create with you. This may be a project that you have been putting off or have only just decided to tackle but with our help you will stay motivated and be happier when you finish. We will be keeping tabs on you! When it is done it will be to that higher professional spec you are no doubt trying to achieve.</p>
                <h3>Corporate Training</h3>
                <p>We offer in person training to companies who want to support their employees to live and work smarter. An efficient home and office makes happier people who get work done. Consider us for your next in-house training day. It is a skills base that your employees will be thoroughly grateful for. And you will see the results permeate through the organisation! Pardon the pun!</p>
