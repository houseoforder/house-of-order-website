            About House of Order Ltd.,
            As busy mothers and employees, friends Asia, Kasia and Rachel shared the frustrations of
            keeping a home tidy with each other. We decided to help each other 'get our homes in
            order' and realised we were so good at it that it was a service that we could offer others.
            First it was with wider family and friends but through recommendations from those who
            know and trust us we have grown to encompass so much more than just 'decluttering'. We
            listen and understand our clients needs. Our services aim to 'get your home in order' and in
            so doing improve your daily life with systems and organisation that you can maintain and
            enjoy.
            Services
            All services are available for private homes or commercial premises.
            Organising and Decluttering
            After a free no obligation consultation we will offer you a personalised decluttering and
            space organisation package. Some people opt to do their whole house while others prefer
            to start with one room and we come back when they are ready to tackle the next section of
            their homes. No job is too big or too small! And don't worry about the mess, we have seen it
            all and we love a challenge.
            Pre and most move packing and installing service
            Moving house is categorised as an event that over 65% of those interviewed considered
            more stressful than a job interview or a medical proceedure. With our help it doesn't have
            to be like that. The earlier we get the call the better prepared we will be to advise and assist
            you. Moving has so many logistics and there is also the emotional and social upheaval that
            come with it. We can handle the entirety of organising and moving you from A to B so that

            your life can begin in a new place with all your home comforts and minus the chaos of trying
            to do it all by yourself.

            House clearance after bereavement
            We understand that having lost someone close the energy it will take to sort, dispose, and
            move their belongings without professional support can be truly daunting. During grief
            taking on such a huge project can seem too much for even the most capable people and we
            aim to render this service with compassion and care. Let us help you through this difficult
            time.

            Corporate Move

            taking of many photographs we can present your home for the results you desire. Having an
            outsiders eye we can ensure that only the best of your home is seen and appreciated by
            viewers.

            you finish. We will be keeping tabs on you! When it is done it will be to that higher

            Decluttering: Simple Hints and Tips That Actually Work
            Decluttering isn't about having a picture-perfect home or getting rid of everything you own.
            It's about creating space—physically and mentally—so your home supports your life instead
            of overwhelming it. Whether you're just starting out or feeling stuck halfway through, these
            simple hints and tips will help you declutter in a way that feels manageable and lasting.
            Start Small (Really Small)
            One of the biggest mistakes people make is trying to declutter an entire house in one go.
            That's a fast track to burnout. Instead, start with a single drawer, shelf, or surface.
            Completing a small area gives you a sense of achievement and motivation to keep going.
            Progress builds confidence.
            Declutter by Category, Not Just by Room
            While room-by-room decluttering works for many, sometimes it's easier to declutter by
            category—clothes, paperwork, books, or kitchen gadgets. Seeing everything you own in one
            category helps you make clearer decisions and avoid duplicates or excess.
            Ask Better Questions
            Instead of asking, “Should I get rid of this?”, try:
             Do I use this regularly?
             Would I buy this again today?
             Does this support the life I want now?
            Shifting the question often makes decisions feel less emotional and more intentional.
            Create Clear Zones
            Everything in your home should ideally have a “home” of its own. Group similar items
            together and store them where you actually use them. When items live close to where they're
            needed, tidying becomes quicker and clutter is less likely to creep back in.
            Be Honest About 'Someday'
            We all have items saved for a version of life that hasn't happened yet. Be kind but honest
            with yourself. If something hasn't been used in years and doesn't realistically fit your current
            lifestyle, it may be time to let it go. Letting go of “someday” items often creates space for the
            life you're living now.
            Don't Aim for Perfection
            Decluttering isn't a one-off event—it's an ongoing process. Homes are lived in, and a bit of
            mess is normal. Aim for systems that are easy to maintain rather than perfection. If it's simple
            to put things away, you're far more likely to keep your space clutter-free.

            Build in Maintenance
            Once you've decluttered, protect your progress. A quick weekly reset or a five-minute daily
            tidy can make a huge difference. Regular check-ins prevent clutter from building back up and
            keep your home feeling calm and organised.
            Decluttering doesn't have to be overwhelming or emotional. With small steps, clear systems,
            and realistic expectations, you can create a home that feels lighter, calmer, and far easier to
            live in—one space at a time.
